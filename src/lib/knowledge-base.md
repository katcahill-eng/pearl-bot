## Workflow Boundaries

- **Marketing** = creative and brand (design, copy, templates, assets)
- **CX** = HubSpot execution, automations, email building
- **Requesting department** = content drafts, final approval, operational execution
- **EA** = event logistics (venue, reservations, RSVPs)
- Printed materials and production costs are charged back to the requesting department
- Marketing does NOT provide on-site conference support
- Marketing team is 1.5 people — capacity is limited

---

## Multi-Type Requests

Some requests span multiple types (e.g., a conference that includes a webinar, or a webinar with an email campaign). When a request covers multiple types:

- Ask follow-up questions for **each applicable type** — e.g., conference logistics AND webinar format
- Combine deliverables from both types in the final summary
- Use the primary type for classification, but note all types in the request

**Common combos:**
- **Conference + Webinar:** Conference booth materials + a live or evergreen webinar tied to the event
- **Conference + Email:** Conference collateral + pre/post-conference email campaigns
- **Webinar + Email:** Webinar setup + promotional email sequence
- **Insider Dinner + Email:** Dinner branding + invitation email campaign

---

## General Notes

- **Brainstorm/calendar option:** Available for all request types. If requesters aren't sure what they need, marketing can do a brainstorm session or help plan a content calendar.
- **Presentation timelines:** Work backwards from the presentation date. Ask about the approval chain and build in buffer time for reviews.
- **Expectation setting:** When discussing requests, naturally mention relevant boundaries (e.g., "printed materials are charged back to your department" or "CX handles the HubSpot build — we'll write the copy").
