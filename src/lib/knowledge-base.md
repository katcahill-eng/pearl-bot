### Webinars

**Types — we offer three formats:**

- **Live:** A one-time, real-time presentation via Zoom Webinars. Best for interactive sessions where you want live Q&A, audience polls, or real-time engagement. Great for product launches, expert panels, or topics that benefit from live energy.

- **Pre-recorded:** Fully produced content hosted on GoTo with automated playback. Best when you want a polished, edited presentation without the risk of live technical issues. Good for training content or evergreen topics where live interaction isn't needed.

- **Evergreen:** Record a live session via GoTo, then host it on-demand as an automated encore — it looks and feels live to new registrants, with recurring scheduled sessions and automated registration. Best for scaling a great live session into an ongoing lead-generation tool. Run ads and emails to it over time without re-recording.

**You can combine formats:** Start with a live webinar, then convert the recording into an evergreen session. This is a great strategy — get the live energy and Q&A first, then turn it into an automated encore you can promote with ads and emails over time.

We offer three formats: *Live* (real-time via Zoom, great for Q&A), *Pre-recorded* (polished and edited, automated playback via GoTo), or *Evergreen* (record a live session, then run it on-demand as an automated encore). You can also start live and convert to evergreen later — not sure which fits? We can help you decide.
- What is the topic and who is the presenter?

## Multi-Type Requests

Some requests span multiple types (e.g., a conference that includes a webinar, or a webinar with an email campaign). When a request covers multiple types:

- Ask follow-up questions for **each applicable type** — e.g., conference logistics AND webinar format
- Combine deliverables from both types in the final summary
- Use the primary type for classification, but note all types in the request

**Common combos:**
- **Conference + Webinar:** Conference booth materials + a live or evergreen webinar tied to the event
- **Conference + Email:** Conference collateral + pre/post-conference email campaigns
- **Webinar + Email:** Webinar setup + promotional email sequence
- **Insider Dinner + Email:** Dinner branding + invitation email campaign

---

## General Notes

- **Brainstorm/calendar option:** Available for all request types. If requesters aren't sure what they need, marketing can do a brainstorm session or help plan a content calendar.
- **Presentation timelines:** Work backwards from the presentation date. Ask about the approval chain and build in buffer time for reviews.
- **Expectation setting:** When discussing requests, naturally mention relevant boundaries (e.g., "printed materials are charged back to your department" or "CX handles the HubSpot build — we'll write the copy").
